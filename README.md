# Overview

This is a `clone and run` benchmark template that runs google benchmark. I use this locally a lot and thought maybe more people can use it too!

# Requirements
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- A cpp compiler (havent tested with clang, but it should work)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned the repo, setup cmake with `cmake -S . -B build`. The binaries should be automatically copied in to the bin folder (no mater the build config or platform).
